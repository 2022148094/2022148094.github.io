description: "Developed a program to segment images by representing them as weighted graphs (pixels as vertices, color dissimilarity as edge weights). Implemented a modified Kruskal's algorithm to create a spanning forest, successfully grouping similarly colored pixels into distinct segments. Each tree in the forest represented a unique region of the original image."
